# Text Mining - Exploration

How to deal with variables like: *natural language*.


```R
# loading packages
library(tidyverse)
library(tidytext)
library(janeaustenr)
library(stringr)
```

I'll load Jane Austen books from the package janeaustenr and do some cleaning.


```R
original_books <- austen_books() %>%
  group_by(book) %>%
  mutate(linenumber = row_number(),
         chapter = cumsum(str_detect(text, regex("^chapter [\\divxlc]",
                                                 ignore_case = TRUE)))) %>%
  ungroup()
```


```R
original_books
```

Now I'll change the form of the dataframe using a function from the `tidytext` package called the `unnest_tokens()` function.


```R
tidy_books <- original_books %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, text)
```


```R
tidy_books
```

The function separates all the words from the text lines.

Nexr I will display the words more used in all the books:


```R
# first create a table of frequency of the words
words = table(tidy_books$word)

```R

wd = na.omit(words[words > dim(words)/6])

Now we can see the first 6 words with the most frequency count in all the books. Let's plot:


```R
ggplot(ord_ws, aes(x = reorder (Var1, -Freq), y = Freq)) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
    theme(text = element_text(size = 12), axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 50))
